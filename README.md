Hello everyone,

This project is another example of my frontend development skills in React. It's a simple and minimalistic project that I designed based on a custom Figma layout. You can find the designer's link at the bottom.

The project serves as an introduction to a cafe and its services. In the future, I plan to expand it to include a product page, possibly enable online sales, and develop an admin dashboard, turning it into a comprehensive showcase.

I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in this project, and it is an ongoing endeavor.

I hope you like it, and please consider giving it a star!
